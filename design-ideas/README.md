# Design Ideas

This directory is a lightweight workspace for design ideas across **mcprojsim**: both project-level concepts and supporting infrastructure ideas.

### Build PDF Documents

PDFs can be built in both light and dark themes. From this directory, run:

```bash
make
```

To build PDFs in dark theme, run:

```bash
make dark
```

This builds PDF versions of the design markdown documents in light or dark theme and stores them in `dist/` using 
versioned filenames and theme-specific suffixes.

### Clean up temporary build artifacts

```bash
make clean
```

### Remove all built files including generated PDFs

```bash
make really-clean
```

> [!NOTE]
> All PDFs are generated through the shared LaTeX template: `design_template.tex` (light theme) and `design_template_dark.tex` (dark theme).
