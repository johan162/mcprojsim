🚀 ${PROGRAMNAME_PRETTY} Release Script

DESCRIPTION:
    Automated release script for ${PROGRAMNAME} with comprehensive quality gates.
    Performs validation, testing, versioning, and git operations for releases.

USAGE:
    $0 <version> [release-type] [options]

ARGUMENTS:
    version         Semantic version number (e.g., 2.1.0, 1.0.0, 0.9.1)
                    Must follow semver format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

    release-type    Type of release (default: minor)
                    • major   - Breaking changes, incompatible API changes
                    • minor   - New features, backwards compatible  
                    • patch   - Bug fixes, backwards compatible

OPTIONS:
    --dry-run       Preview all commands without executing them
                    Shows exactly what would be done without making changes
                    
    --help, -h      Show this help message and exit

EXAMPLES:
    # Show help
    $0 --help
    
    # Preview a minor release (recommended first step)
    $0 2.1.0 minor --dry-run
    
    # Execute a minor release
    $0 2.1.0 minor
    
    # Create a patch release with preview
    $0 2.0.1 patch --dry-run
    $0 2.0.1 patch

    # Create a major release
    $0 3.0.0-rc1 major --dry-run
    $0 3.0.0-rc1 major

QUALITY GATES:
    The script enforces comprehensive quality controls:
    ✓ Repository state validation (clean working directory)
    ✓ Test suite execution (>90% coverage requirement)
    ✓ Static analysis and code formatting checks
    ✓ Integration testing with all example networks
    ✓ Package building and validation via twine
    ✓ Semver compliance and duplicate version prevention
    ✓ Version consistency across all project files

WORKFLOW:
    1. Pre-release validation (repository state, version format, changelog presence)
    2. Comprehensive testing (unit tests, integration, static analysis)
    3. Release preparation (version updates, release assets)
    4. Release execution (git commit, merge, tag, push)
    5. Post-release cleanup (sync branches, clean artifacts)

REQUIREMENTS:
    • Must be run from project root directory
    • Must be on 'develop' branch with clean working directory
    • Requires: git, python, poetry, gh
    • Requires an existing CHANGELOG.md entry for the planned version
    • Requires Poetry dev dependencies installed (run: poetry install)

SAFETY:
    • Use --dry-run first to preview all operations
    • Script validates all conditions before making changes
    • Fails fast on any error to prevent partial releases
    • All git operations are atomic and reversible
